# Soundboard-App

I developed a soundboard app for my personal use, primarily targeting Android while also being compatible with web browsers using React Native. I'm currently working on making it compatible with iOS devices as well. The app has a user interface that resembles a Stream Deck, featuring buttons with similar styles. Furthermore, the app allows users to create and store their custom buttons using the Async Storage system.
